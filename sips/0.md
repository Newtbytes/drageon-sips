# IRBuilder: Intermediate Representation Builder System

A language frontend has the job of parsing an input file into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and lowering that into an Intermediate Language (IL). However, the AST is not structured in a way that easily allows for lowering to the SSA-like operation-based IL infrastructure that is planned for SillyDrageon. I propose an IRBuilder for the purposes of lowering an AST into operations and basic blocks.
